## Tips for IntelliJ
Since all days share the same class name you need to have only one `src` folder marked as source root at the same time.
Unmark the days you are not using with `Mark Directory As -> Unmark As Source Root`

## Testing
- run all `./test.sh`
- run specific day `./test.sh <day>` where `<day>` is a day number, i.e `1`
