## Tips for IntelliJ
Since all days share the same class name you need to have only one `src` folder marked as source root at the same time.
Unmark the days you are not using with `Mark Directory As -> Unmark As Source Root`

## Testing
A crude test script is located in `test/Test.java`. The test verifies that docker containers can be built and executed with the correct answers.
The easiest way to execute the test is to run `./test.sh` in root folder from commandline.
